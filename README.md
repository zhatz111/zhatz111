### Work Projects

I'm currently working at GSK as a Senior Scientist in Upstream Process development where I've had the opportunity to take on a variety of data science projects as well. Some of these in a Model predictive controller (MPC) for process optimization and disturbance rejection, also Raman modeling of various cell metabolites. 

The MPC project has taught me techniques to model various systems, in this case a fed-batch bioreactor. I have trained, tested, and validated these models by performing in-silico demonstrations of the Model Predictive Controller to show its effectivness at process variability reduction. These models have gone on to be tested in real life experiments which continue to demonstrate reliable and accurate results as seen from the in-silico experiments. 

I am also involved in Raman modeling where I have learned techniques such as PCA, PLS and variable selection algorithms like genetic algorithm. My recent focus on Raman is spectra quality control where I am defining metrics to evaluate the quality of spectras coming from our analyzers in hopes to detect poor quality spectra that can be discarded before model building.
